# The Rotten Saga
This is my first ever video game project. I am excited to be able to share the process from start to finish!
Inspired by games such as Dragon Quest, Fire Emlem, Pok√©mon, and other classic JRPGs, this title takes place in
a medieval setting where the main protagonist awakens in a graveyard as an undead creature. 

With no memories or clue as to how you arrived in this world, you must venture out to discover your origins.
